 # Surfs Up 🏄🏼‍♀️🏄🏼‍♂️
 
## Overview 
During the course of this challenge, we had the opportunity to aid W. Avy, famous surfer and investor, by creating an anlysis to highlight a path to make an important business decision. W. Avy had an idea of creating an ice cream shop that sold surf gear - the shop's name would be "Surf n' Shake Shop" on the island of Oahu. The analysis consisted of creating a data frame that pulled infromation from the local weater websites of Hawaii. The analysis helped W. Avy determine if an ice cream surf shop would be a successful business endevaour. 

## Resources 
Utlized SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask using Python, Jupyter Notebok, and VSCode.

## Results 

The analysis targeted the temperate data from June and December. Focusing on these two allowed us to focus on the weather patterns.
- *The tables below showcase the statistics from June and December*

1. Temperate ranges vary more in December than in June.
2. The standard deveiation for both months were roughly around 3~ degrees.
3. The maximum temperature in June - December varied by only 3 degrees, this is key as the ice cream wouldn't melt during either months! 
4. The minimum temperature in December can get as low as 54 degrees. This is concerned as W. Avy wannts the ice cream store to function throughout the entirety of the year.
